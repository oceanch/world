##fonts
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with ***Markdown***. 

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

 <del>tags</del> = ~~tag~~
##listing
# This is an `<h1>` tag
## This is an `<h2>` tag
###### This is an `<h6>` tag


* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
  
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b 
The listing number keeps increasing, no matter what number you add. 
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  1. level 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

##Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

##Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

##tasks list
Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

##table
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

##coding
There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
